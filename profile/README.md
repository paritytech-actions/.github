## Welcome to `paritytech-actions` ðŸ‘‹

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation platform that enables developers to automate their workflows
and streamline their software development processes. With Actions, you can build, test, and deploy
your code right from your GitHub repository, all within a single, unified platform.


`paritytech-actions` organization is dedicated to host forks of open-source GitHub Actions available
from an official [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
and other sources.

The goal of this internal marketplace is to provide unified infrastructure of a GitHub Actions usage and management within [`paritytech`](https://github.com/paritytech) organization.

* Already available GitHub Actions can be found at the [`paritytech-actions` page](https://paritytech-actions.github.io/actions-marketplace/).
